UICollectionViewContinuousScrolling
===================================

A test project which I built for an assignment. Uses a UICollectionView to browse a set of books retrieved from an API. Supports continuous scrolling and proper fetching of more books from the API. Uses CoreData for caching books and browsing when API fails or user is offline.
